A database backend (currently Oracle) is used to store certain bits of information that are important for the operation of the VLBA-DiFX correlator.
The same physical database is used to store monitor data from VLBA observations and log data from foreign stations that are processed through {\tt fs2db}.
This version of this document describes only new features, including database tables not used in the hardware correlator era and the
software that populates and uses this information.
The new software in question accesses the database through one of two mechanisms.  
Python programs use the {\tt cx\_Oracle} library and Java programs (e.g., the DiFX Operator Interface) use {\tt JAXB}.

\subsection{The DIFXQUEUE table}

The DIFXQUEUE table is used to specify the state of the correlator queue.
Each job can have a unique entry in this table.
The structure of this table is based on the FXQUEUE table used by {\tt OMS}, but this table is incompatible with {\tt OMS} and should be treated as a completely parallel development.
The program {\tt difxqueue} will populate this table for each job being staged for correlation.
Initially the STATUS field will be ``QUEUED'', but will change to one of the other options in the course of correlation.
The DiFX Operator Interface (DOI) uses this database table directly.

   \multicolumn{1}{l}{Column}
 & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Type}
 & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Comments}
\\
\hline
PROPOSAL	& VARCHAR2(10)	& The proposal code \\
SEGMENT		& VARCHAR2(2)	& Segment (epoch) of proposal, or blank \\
JOB\_PASS	& VARCHAR2(32)	& Name of correlator pass (e.g. ``geodesy'') \\
JOB\_NUMBER	& INTEGER	& Number of job in the pass \\
PRIORITY	& INTEGER	& Number indicating the priority of the job in the queue; \\
		&		& 1 is high, 2 is default, and 3 is low \\
JOB\_START	& DATE		& Observe time of job start \\
JOB\_STOP	& DATE		& Observe time of job stop \\
SPEEDUP         & FLOAT         & Estimated speed-up factor for job \\
INPUT\_FILE	& VARCHAR2(512)	& Full path of the VLBA-DiFX input file \footnote{INPUT\_FILE is the primary key for this table.} \\
STATUS		& VARCHAR2(32)	& Status of the job, perhaps ``QUEUED'', ``KILLED'', \\
		&		& ``RUNNING'', ``FAILED'', ``UNKNOWN'' or ``COMPLETE'' \\
NUM\_ANT	& INTEGER	& Number of antennas in the job \\
CORR\_TYPE      & VARCHAR2(32)  & Type of correlation (e.g., ``PRODUCTION'' or ``CLOCK'') \\
CORR\_VERSION   & VARCHAR2(32)  & The DiFX version string \\
NUM\_FOREIGN    & INTEGER       & Number of non-VLBA antennas in job \\
OUTPUT\_SIZE\_EST & INTEGER       & Estimated correlator output size (MB) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{The DIFXLOG table}

The DIFXLOG table contains a list of all correlation attempts and is basesd on the FXLOG table used by the hardware correlator and {\tt OMS}.
In the case of successful correlation, the CORR\_STATUS field will be set to ``COMPLETE'' and the SPEEDUP and OUTPUT\_SIZE fields will be set.

JOB\_NUMBER	& INTEGER	& Number of job in the pass \\
CORR\_START	& DATE		& Start time/date of correlation \\
CORR\_STOP	& DATE		& Stop time/date of correlation \\
SPEEDUP         & FLOAT         & Measured speed-up factor \\
INPUT\_FILE     & VARCHAR2(512) & File name of .input file \\
OUTPUT\_FILE	& VARCHAR2(512)	& File name of correlator output \\
OUTPUT\_SIZE	& INTEGER	& Size (in $10^6$\,bytes) of correlator output \\
CORR\_STATUS	& VARCHAR2(32)	& Status of correlation, typically ``COMPLETED'' \\
CORR\_TYPE      & VARCHAR2(32)  & Type of correlation (e.g., ``PRODUCTION'' or ``CLOCK'') \\
CORR\_VERSION   & VARCHAR2(32)  & The DiFX version string \\
\hline

\subsection{The CONDITION table}

The CONDITION table contains performance information for the hard disks comprising Mark5 modules.
A separate table entry is made for each disk in a module so typically there will be 8 entries generated for each module conditioned.
There are two paths to get data into this table.
The {\tt condition} program can be used to manually load condition reports from the SSErase program.
Secondly, the {\tt condition\_watch} program automatically populates the database immediately after module conditioning upon receipt of a {\tt Mark5ConditionMessage} that is now generated by a specially modified version of Haystack Observatory's {\tt SSErase} program.
