The {\tt difxmessage} library (\S\ref{sec:difxmessage}) implements a system for sending and receiving messages using XML format.
This section documents the ``difxMessage'' XML document type that is used for interprocess communication during correlation within DiFX.
These messages are sent via UDP multicast and are thus restricted to fit within one standard-sized Ethernet packet ($\sim$1500 bytes).
Various logging and monitoring programs ({\tt mk5mon}, {\tt cpumon}, and {\tt errormon}, all eventually to be replaced by a single interactive operator interface) can accept these messages and perform actions based on their content.
Several different message types are derived from the following XML base type:

\begin{quotation}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\|\[\]]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<difxMessage>
  <header>
    <from>|bfit[from]</from>
    <to>|bfit[to]</to>
    <mpiProcessId>|bfit[mpiId]</mpiProcessId>
    <identifier>|bfit[idString]</identifier>
    <type>|bfit[messageType]</type>
  </header>
  <body>
    <seqNumber>|bfit[seqNum]</seqNumber>
    |bfit[body]
  </body>
</difxMessage>
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quotation}

\noindent The italicized fields are as follows:

\begin{description}

\item[\bfit{from}] the hostname of the sender.
\item[\bfit{to}] the intended recipient of the XML document.
Note that this field is typically not included for report-only messages as it's intended purpose is for directing commands to particular recipients.
Also note that multiple \bfit{to} fields can be present in a message.
Three ``shortcuts'' are currently allowed: {\tt all} causes all receiving programs (such as {\tt mk5daemon}) on all software correlator cluster members to respond; {\tt mark5} causes all Mark5 units to respond; and {\tt swc} causes all non-Mark5 units to respond.
\item[\bfit{mpiId}] the MPI process id of the sender.  
If there are $D$ (typically 10) datastream processes (i.e., Mark5 units playing back), then \bfit{mpiId} takes on the following numbers:

\begin{tabular}{cl}
value    & {\tt mpifxcorr} process type \\
\hline
$< 0$    & a process not associated with {\tt mpifxcorr} \\
$0$      & the manager process of {\tt mpifxcorr} \\
1 to $D$ & one of the datastream processes \\
$\ge D+1$  & one of the core (computing) processes 
\end{tabular}

\item[\bfit{idString}] an additional string identifying the source of the message.  
For messages sent from {\tt mpifxcorr}, this will be the job id, for example {\tt job3322.000}.  
Other programs will typically set this field to the name of the program sending the message. 
\item[\bfit{messageType}] the type of message being sent:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
value    & description of message type \\
\hline
{\tt DifxAlertMessage} & an error message. \\
{\tt DifxCommand} & a command message. \\
{\tt DifxLoadMessage} & CPU and memory usage (usually sent by {\tt mk5daemon}). \\
{\tt DifxParameterMessage} & specify new parameter value to an {\tt mpifxcorr} process. \\
{\tt DifxStartMessage} & tell head node to start a difx job. \\
{\tt DifxStopMessage} & tell {\tt mk5daemon} to stop a particular instance of {\tt mpifxcorr}. \\
{\tt DifxStatusMessage} & status of the {\tt mpifxcorr} program. \\
{\tt Mark5ConditionMessage} & Mark5 module conditioning statistics for one disc. \\
{\tt Mark5StatusMessage} & status of the mark5 unit and modules. \\
{\tt Mark5VersionMessage} & versions, board types and serial numbers of a Streamstor card. 
\end{tabular}

\noindent Each of these message types is described in sections that follow.

\item[\bfit{seqNum}] the sequence number (starting at 0) of messages coming from the particular program running on the particular host.
The number advances by 1 for each sent message and can be used to detect lost packets.
\item[\bfit{body}] message contents that are specific to the particular \bfit{messageType}.
See sections that follow.
\end{description}

A ``C'' language library for generating, multicasting, receiving, and parsing XML documents of this type is used within some of the programs, including {\tt mpifxcorr} (the core of the DiFX \cite{difx} software correlator) and {\tt mk5daemon} (a program that runs on each Mark5 unit that is responsible for multicast communication when {\tt mpifxcorr} is not running), that transact these XML documents.
The default multicast group to be used is 224.2.2.1 and the default port is 50200, though these can be overridden with environment variables {\tt DIFX\_MESSAGE\_GROUP} and {\tt DIFX\_MESSAGE\_PORT} respectively.






% DifxAlertMessage ------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{DifxAlertMessage} \label{sec:difxalertmessage}

This section describes messages with \bfit{messageType} = {\tt DifxAlertMessage}.
These messages come from mpifxcorr or the head node agent and contain an error message string and severity code that should be displayed to the operator and logged.

The \bfit{body} of the message contains:

\begin{quotation}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\|\[\]]
    <difxAlert>
      <alertMessage>|bfit[message]</alertMessage>
      <severity>|bfit[severity]</severity>

\end{Verbatim}
\end{quotation}


\noindent The italicized fields are as follows:

\begin{description}
\item{\bfit{message}} a string containing the error message.
\item{\bfit{severity}} an integer indicating the severity. 
The severity scale is based on that from the EVLA and has values with the following meanings:

\begin{tabular}{cll}
value    & name & meaning \\
\hline
0 & FATAL   & processing has failed; a restart is needed  \\
1 & SEVERE  & data from one or more station is affected badly \\
2 & ERROR   & data from one or more station may be affected; e.g., low weights \\
3 & WARNING & minor error of no consequence to ongoing processing \\
4 & INFO    & informational only \\

\end{tabular}

\end{description}






% DifxCommand -----------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{DifxCommand}

This section describes messages with \bfit{messageType} = {\tt DifxCommand}.
These messages require the \bfit{to} field to be set and cause the intended recipient to take an action.

\begin{quotation} 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\|\[\]] 
    <difxCommand>
      <command>|bfit[command]</command>
    </difxCommand>
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quotation}

\noindent The italicized field is as follows:

\begin{description}

{\tt Reboot} & causes machine to reboot. \\
{\tt Poweroff} & causes machine to power down. \\
{\tt Copy <bank> <vsn> <scans>} & causes scans to be copied to local disk. \\
\end{tabular}






% DifxLoadMessage -------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{DifxLoadMessage}

This section describes messages with \bfit{messageType} = {\tt DifxLoadMessage}.
These messages contain CPU and memory utilization information and are voluntarily sent by various nodes of the cluster, to be received by the operator interface.

The \bfit{body} of this message type contains:

\begin{quotation}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\|\[\]]
    <difxLoad>
      <cpuLoad>|bfit[cpuLoad]</cpuLoad>

      <targetMipId>|bfit[id]</targetMpiId>
      <name>|bfit[name]</name>
      <index1>|bfit[index1]</index1>
      .
      .
      .
      <indexN>|bfit[indexN]</indexN>
      <value>|bfit[value]</value>
    </difxParameter>
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quotation}

Such a message is intended to allow a parameter, possibly qualified with array indices, to be set to a particular value.

\noindent The italicized fields are as follows:

\begin{description}
\item{\bfit{targetMpiId}} the MPI process Id (rank) to target with this message.
Values zero and greater target specific MPI processes, with zero always being the manager process.
Other special values include:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
value & meaning \\
\hline
-1 & all MPI processes \\
-2 & all core (processing) processes \\
-3 & all datastream processes \\
\end{tabular}

\item{\bfit{name}} the name of the parameter to set.

\end{description}






% DifxTransientMessage -------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{DifxTransientMessage}

This section describes messages with \bfit{messageType} = {\tt DifxTransientMessage}.
This message is related to a commensal transient search project.
A message of this type should be sent as soon as possible after detection; it is likely that no provisions will be made for data copying that does not start before resources assigned to the job are released.
When a possible transient is identfied by a detecting program which looks at autocorrelations it sends this message to all Mark5 units.  
Once correlation is complete, the {\tt mk5daemon} program on appropriate Mark5 units will take a few seconds to copy data from the time range(s) of interest.

The \bfit{body} of this message type contains:

\begin{quotation}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\|\[\]]
    <difxTransient>
      <jobId>|bfit[jobId]</jobId>
      <startMJD>|bfit[startMJD]</startMJD>
      <stopMJD>|bfit[stopMJD]</stopMJD>
      <priority>|bfit[priority]</priority>
      <destDir>|bfit[destDir]</destDir>
      <comment>|bfit[comment]</comment>
    </difxTransient>
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quotation}

\noindent The italicized fields are as follows:

\begin{description}
\item{\bfit{jobId}} The job indentification string.
This is required so that only relevant Mark5 units take action on the received message.
\item{\bfit{eventId}} A string containing the name of the event as declared by the transient detector.
\item{\bfit{startMJD}} The start time (MJD) of the segment of data to copy.
\item{\bfit{stopMJD}} The stop time (MJD) of the segment of data to copy.
Note that the total amount of data to be copied should be low enough to have an inconsequential impact on correlation throughput.
\item{\bfit{priority}} A floating point value indicating the relative importance of capturing this event.
In jobs where many triggers occur this field will be used to select the most important ones to save to disk.
Higher numbers indicate higher priority.
\item{\bfit{destDir}} (optional) A final directory to store the baseband data.
If not provided, a default will be assumed.
Note that behavior is undefined if different destination directories are provided within a single job.
\item{\bfit{classification}} (optional) A string provided by the transient detector containing a tentative classification.
\item{\bfit{comment}} (optional) A comment that could be appended to a log file.
\end{description}

All data and a log file will be stored in a subdirectory of the data staging area named \bfit{jobId}.
The log file, at a minimum, will contain the list of events sent by the transient detection program and a log of the copying process, indicating any errors that may have occured.
The subdirectory will have a temporary name starting with a period ({\tt .}) until all data copy for the job in question is complete.
The use of this message type is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:transient}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{4in}{!}{\includegraphics{transient}}
\caption[blockdiagram]{
{{\em The sequence of events leading to transient data capture.}
First the DiFX Operator Interface sends a {\tt DifxStart} message to the head node, causing the {\tt mpifxcorr} process to be started.
The core nodes of {\tt mpifxcorr} will transmit autocorrelation data to a real-time transient detection algorithm.
As interesting events are identified, {\tt DifxTransientMessage} documents are sent to the head node; the {\tt mk5daemon} process keeps a prioritized list of events.
After correlation completes but before {\tt mk5daemon} on the head node starts a series of {\tt mk5cp} processes to run to copy the baseband data from the Mark5 modules before the next job starts.
}
\label{fig:transient}
}
\end{center}
\end{figure}





% DifxStart -------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{DifxStart}

This document type causes the head node to spawn a correlator job.
The doument contents describe which resources to use and which {\tt .input} file to use.

The \bfit{body} of the message contains:

\begin{quotation}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\|\[\]]
    <difxStart>
      <input>|bfit[input file]</input>
      <force>|bfit[forceOverwrite]</force>
      <manager node="|bfit[node]" />
      <datastream nodes="|bfit[nodes]" />
      <process nodes="|bfit[nodes]" threads="|bfit[count]" />
      <env>|bfit[envvar]=|bfit[value]</env>
      <difxProgram>|bfit[program]</difxProgram>
      <difxVersion>|bfit[version]</difxVersion>
      <mpiWrapper>|bfit[mpiWrapper]</mpiWrapper>
      <mpiOptions>|bfit[options]</mpiOptions>
    </difxStart>
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quotation}

In the above XML file, exactly one manager node must be supplied.
There must be at least one datastream node (one per antenna being correlated).
There must be at least one process node.
Zero or more (up to a maximum of 8) environment variables may be set.
The italicized fields are as follows:

\begin{description}
\item{\bfit{input file}} complete path to the {\tt .input} file for this correlation.
\item{\bfit{forceOverwrite}} cause any previous correlator output of this job to be deleted before starting the correlation.  A value of {\tt 1} or {\tt True} will enable overwrite.
\item{\bfit{value}} the value of the environment variable.
\item{\bfit{node}} the name of the node being assigned, e.g. {\tt mark5fx02} or {\tt swc000}.
\item{\bfit{nodes}} a list of node names.  The list members should be space or comma separated.

This applies only to process nodes.
\item{\bfit{envvar}} an environment variable to set before running mpifxcorr.
\item{\bfit{program}} the name of the software correlator executable.
This is optional and defaults to {\tt mpifxcorr} if not set.
\item{\bfit{version}} the version (e.g., {\em DIFX-1.5.4}) of DiFX to run.
\item{\bfit{mpiWrapper}} the name of the program used to start the MPI processes.
This field is optional and defaults to {\tt mpirun} if none is provided.
\item{\bfit{options}} extra options to pass to {\tt mpirun}.
This is optional; sensible defaults are assumed if not explicitly set.
\end{description}

Note that multiple {\tt <process />} tags can be specified, each with its own thread count.
Each tag's thread count only affects those nodes specified in that tag.
If {\bfit{version}} is provided, then a wrapper script called {\tt runmpifxcorr.}{\em version} is expected to be in the default path which sets the environment for the version of DiF to actuallyt run.





% DifxStatusMessage -----------------------------------------------------------
