\section{Installation and upgrade guide} \label{sec:install}

This is a module-by-module installation guide that takes one through the installation of the NRAO adaptation of DiFX.
The sections below should be followed more or less in order.
Before you begin installing code, you should take a few moments to prepare your environment.
First choose a top level source directory, here called {\em sourcedir}.
Also choose an installation top level directory, called {\em prefixdir}, which should be visible to all the nodes in the cluster.  
Into this directory, subdirectories such as {\tt bin}, {\tt lib}, {\tt include} will be created containing the installed code from the many packages you will need.
At this time four environment variables need creation or expansion:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt IPPROOT}: \S\ref{sec:ipp}.
Set this to something trivial (such as {\tt .}) until IPP has been installed, then remember to change it as appropriate.
\item {\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}, a standard environment variable containing a dynamic library search path.  
Add {\em prefixdir}{\tt /lib} and {\tt \$IPPROOT/sharedlib} to this path.
\item {\tt PATH}, a standard environment variable containing the execution path.
Add {\em prefixdir}{\tt /bin} to this path.
\item {\tt PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH}, a search path for package installation information.
Add {\em prefixdir}{\tt /lib/pkgconfig} to this path.
\end{enumerate}

Note that all of these environment variables (in addition to those described in \S\ref{sec:env}) are required at run-time as well as compile-time, so it is advisable to put these path commands into your shell initialization file and start a new shell at this point.
Note that these variables will be needed not only in interactive shells, but also non-interactive ones, so be sure that these are set no matter how the shell is invoked.

To download, compile and install the software, you will need the standard gnu tools (gcc, libtool, autoconf, automake, make, ...), python, subversion, and of course ssh.
Be aware that many distributions don't install by default all of these needed tools (xubuntu for example installs very few development tools by default.
Relatively few external libraries are used.
It also assumes you have an account that allows access to the subversion repository at \url{https://svn.atnf.csiro.au}.

\caption[dependencies]{
{\em A diagram illustrating the required and optional packages and their installation dependencies.}
\label{fig:dependencies}
}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The {\tt make install} steps may require root permission, depending on the {\em prefixdir} you have chosen.
If so, become root before each {\tt make install}.  
It is advisable not to compile code as root.
Be wary of errors along the way; occasional warnings may be issued, but if the building proceeds, things are probably okay.
Please report any build issues to {\tt wbrisken@nrao.edu}. 
Be warned that these instructions may change.

All of the subversion repositories below point to a {\tt difx-1.5} tagged release of the repository.
This is in order to provide a relatively stable source tree that allows development to continue on the main development branch (called {\tt trunk}).
In order to check out code that is on this development branch, simply replace {\tt tags/difx-1.5} with {\tt trunk} in all of the {\tt svn} commands below.
{\em Caveat emptor: } the {\tt trunk} branch code may at any time refuse to compile, be unstable, lack documentation, or produce incorrect results.
Don't let this stop you if you are an intrepid developer or want to see ongoing development in progress!

%If you do not have SVN access, {\tt .tar.gz} files are available from \url{http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~wbrisken/difx-1.5/}.








% expat -----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{expat} \label{sec:expat}

Expat is a standard library for simple XML parsing.
By default it is installed on almost all Linux distributions.
If it is not, it can be downloaded and installed based on instructions that can be found at its web page:
\url{http://expat.sourceforge.net/} .








% cx_Oracle -------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{cx\_Oracle} \label{sec:cxOracle}

In the implementation of the VLBA-DiFX operations plans, with the exception of the {\tt DOI}, all of the access to VLBA database is done using python programs that employ the cx\_Oracle library.
This library directly talks to Oracle databases; its use in Python makes for nearly effortless database interfacing.
To install:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the latest source distribution from \url{http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/} (ver.\ 5.0.2 as of this writing)
\item Decompress the contents into perhaps {\em sourcedir}; enter the newly created directory
\item Run {\tt python setup.py build}
\item Make sure install directory exists:  {\tt mkdir -p \$DIFX\_PREFIX/lib/python2.4/site-packages}
\item Run {\tt python setup.py install --prefix=\$DIFX\_PREFIX}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
You should substitute {\tt python2.4} with the string appropriate for your python version.
Proper installation can be tested by running {\tt python} and typing {\tt import cx\_Oracle} at the {\tt >>>} prompt.
If another prompt is given without any ``ImportError'' message, then it should be installed properly.







% openmpi ---------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{OpenMPI} \label{sec:mpi}

The core of DiFX uses Message Passing Interface (MPI) for inter-node communication.
Many MPI libraries exist; we choose to use OpenMPI as it is simple to install, runs well, and appears to have good community support.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the latest source distribution from \url{http://www.open-mpi.org/} (ver.\ 1.4.2 as of this writing)
\item Decompress the contents into perhaps {\em sourcedir}; enter the newly created directory
\item {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em openmpiprefix} where {\em openmpiprefix} could be the same as {\em prefixdir}, but does not have to be.
\item Run {\tt make} and finally {\tt make install} to put the parts where they belong.
\end{enumerate}








% ipp -------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Intel Performance Primitives} \label{sec:ipp}

Intel CPUs support an increasing variety of vector math instructions.  
The Intel Performance Primitives (IPP) makes exploiting these capabilities on any recent generation CPU simple.
An inexpensive license must be purchased to make use of these.
More information can be found on \url{http://www.intel.com}.

Once installed, set environment variable {\tt IPPROOT} to point to its install prefix, which will look something like:
{\tt /home/swc/difx/intel/ipp/6.0.2.076/ia32}; you want to choose the directory containing {\tt lib}, {\tt include}, etc.
Remember to change this in your shell initialization file as well.
This install directory should be visible to all nodes in the cluster.








% fftw ------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{FFTW} \label{sec:fftw}

The FFTs performed by {\tt mpifxcorr} are done using the Intel Performance Primitives library, but FFTs done in an optional piece of{\tt difx2fits} and the utility {\tt m5spec} that comes with mark5access use FFTW, a standard, fast, freely available FFT library.
This library is probably installed for you with any modern Linux distribution, but you should check to make sure it is recent enough; version 3.0 and up are supported, but version 3.1.2 or newer is recommended.
If this library is not installed and the extra functionality that requires FFTW is not installed, follow the instructions below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the latest source distribution from \url{http://www.fftw.org} (ver.\ 3.1.2 as of this writing)
\item Decompress the contents into perhaps {\em sourcedir}; enter the newly created directory
\item {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em prefixdir}
\item Run {\tt make} and finally {\tt make install} to put the parts where they belong.
\end{enumerate}








% streamstor ---------------------------------------------- INCOMPLETE --------









% difxio ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{difxio} \label{sec:difxio}

Parsing of text files can be tedious.  
The library difxio makes parsing difx-style files simple.
It also contains functionality to completely represent the configuration of a DiFX correlation, simplifying format conversions.
To install:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}
\item Check out the subversion repository: \\
{\tt svn co }\url{https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/libraries/difxio/branches/difx-1.5}{\tt\ difxio} \\
{\em Note: don't forget the {\tt difxio} at the end of the line!}
\item Enter the new directory {\tt cd difxio}
\item View the {\tt README} file.  
Note the next 5 instructions only need to be done once in this directory, even after updating the repository.
You can {\tt man} the commands if you want to know what they do.
\item {\tt aclocal}  
\item {\tt libtoolize --copy --force}
\item {\tt autoconf}
\item {\tt autoheader}
\item {\tt automake -a} 
\item Generate the Makefile: {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em prefixdir}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

You can test for successful installation by running {\tt pkg-config --cflags difxio}.  
If you get a sensible answer, things are probably good.
If you wish to upgrade the installation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}{\tt /difxio}
\item Get updates from the repository: {\tt svn update}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

Note that doing this upgrade may break other packages that depend on it, such as {\tt difx2fits} and {\tt calcif}, forcing a recompile of these programs.









% difxmessage -----------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{difxmessage {\small $\mathrm{(optional)}$}} \label{sec:difxmessage}

\vspace{-20pt}\hspace{155pt}
\difxoneone

\vspace{7pt}

\noindent
The library difxmessage implements in the C language XML generation and parsing and multicast sending and receiving functionality that is used for communication between various parts of the DiFX system.
See \S\ref{sec:xml} for details on the XML documents supported.
The communication model is based on that of the EVLA.
This package is optional; if not built, you will not be able to use {\tt mk5daemon} or any program packaged with it, or {\tt genmachines}.
To install:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}
\item Check out the subversion repository: \\
{\tt svn co }\url{https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/libraries/difxmessage/branches/difx-1.5}{\tt\ difxmessage}
\item Enter the new directory {\tt cd difxmessage}
\item View the {\tt README} file.  
Note the next 5 instructions only need to be done once in this directory, even after updating the repository.

\item {\tt libtoolize --copy --force}
\item {\tt autoconf}
\item {\tt autoheader}
\item {\tt automake -a} 
\item Generate the Makefile: {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em prefixdir}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

You can test for successful installation by running {\tt pkg-config --cflags difxmessage}.  
If you get a sensible answer, things are probably good.
If you wish to upgrade the installation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}{\tt /difxio}
\item Get updates from the repository: {\tt svn update}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

Note that doing this upgrade may break other packages that depend on it, such as {\tt mpifxcorr} and {\tt mk5daemon}, forcing a recompile of these programs.









% mark5access -----------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{mark5access} \label{sec:m5a}

mark5access is a library to parse various VLBI baseband data formats, including Mark4, VLBA, and Mark5B, with other formats to be added.
This is needed to decode these various formats from within mpifxcorr.
To install:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}
\item Check out the subversion repository: \\
{\tt svn co }\url{https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/libraries/mark5access/branches/difx-1.5}{\tt\ mark5access}
\item Enter the new directory {\tt cd mark5access}
\item View the {\tt README} file.  
Note the next 5 instructions only need to be done once in this directory, even after updating the repository.
\item {\tt aclocal}  
\item {\tt libtoolize --copy --force}
\item {\tt autoconf}
\item {\tt autoheader}
\item {\tt automake -a} 
\item Generate the Makefile: {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em prefixdir}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

You can test for successful installation by running {\tt pkg-config --cflags mark5access}.  
If you get a sensible answer, things are probably good.
If you wish to upgrade the installation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}{\tt /mark5access}
\item Get updates from the repository: {\tt svn update}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

Note that doing this upgrade may break other packages that depend on it, such as {\tt mpifxcorr}, forcing a recompile of these programs.









% mpifxcorr -------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{mpifxcorr}

The core of the DiFX software correlator is {\tt mpifxcorr}.  
Installation and running this program requires that MPI (\S\ref{sec:mpi}), IPP (\S\ref{sec:ipp}), difxio and mark5access all be installed.
To install:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}
\item Check out the subversion repository: \\
{\tt svn co }\url{https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/mpifxcorr/branches/difx-1.5}{\tt\ mpifxcorr}
\item Enter the new directory {\tt cd mpifxcorr}
\item View the {\tt README} file.  
Note the next 4 instructions only need to be done once in this directory, even after updating the repository.
\item {\tt aclocal}
\item {\tt autoconf}
\item {\tt autoheader}
\item {\tt automake -a}
\item Generate the Makefile: {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em prefixdir} {\tt CXX=}{\em openmpiprefix}{\tt /bin/mpicxx}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

If successfully installed, the command {\tt which mpifxcorr} should return {\em prefixdir}{\tt /bin/mpifxcorr}.
If you wish to upgrade the installation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}{\tt /mpifxcorr}
\item Get updates from the repository: {\tt svn update}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}








% calcserver ------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{calcserver} \label{sec:calcserver}

The Goddard Space Flight Center CALC package version 9.1 is used to calculate the delay models needed for time-alignment of the raw data.
This software is wrapped in a program that exposes the capabilities of CALC via a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and this program runs as a server.
An environment variable {\tt CALC\_SERVER} should be set that contains the name of the computer running {\tt calcserver}.
Within DiFX, the only program that makes use of this server is {\tt calcif2} (\S\ref{sec:calcif2}).
To install:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}
\item Check out the subversion repository: \\
{\tt svn co }\url{https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/applications/calcserver/branches/difx-1.5}{\tt\ calcserver}
\item Enter the new directory {\tt cd calcserver}
\item View the {\tt README} file.
\item {\tt aclocal}
\item {\tt libtoolize --copy --force}
\item {\tt autoconf}
\item {\tt automake -a}
\item Generate the Makefile: {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em prefixdir}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

Since {\tt calcserver} is a single-instance program that is always running as a service, it is usually convenient to have this program start upon boot of the calcserver host.
The calcserver distribution produces a file called {\em srcDir}{\em calcserver/init.d/calcserver} that can be copied (as root) to the system {\tt /etc/init.d} directory.
After doing so, the {\tt /etc/rc.d} directories may need to be updated to run this script at the right time.
On RedHat systems, this is done with:

\noindent
{\tt /sbin/chkconfig --add calcserver}








% calcif2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{calcif2} \label{package:calcif2}

The {\tt calcif2} package contains several programs that are useful for DiFX input file creation and managing correlation, most notably {\tt calcif2} .
Note that this package used to be called {\em job2difx}.
To install:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}
\item Check out the subversion repository: \\
{\tt svn co }\url{https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/utilities/branches/difx-1.5/calcif2}{\tt\ calcif2}
\item Enter the new directory {\tt cd calcif2}
\item View the {\tt README} file.  
Note the next 4 instructions only need to be done once in this directory, even after updating the repository.
\item {\tt aclocal}
\item {\tt autoconf}
\item {\tt autoheader}
\item {\tt automake -a}
\item Generate the Makefile: {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em prefixdir}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

If successfully installed, the command {\tt which calcif2} should return {\em prefixdir}{\tt /bin/calcif2}.
Several other programs should also be installed, including: {\tt genmachines}, {\tt getjobs}, {\tt jobdisks}, {\tt joblist}, {\tt jobstatus}, {\tt difxsniff}, {\tt mk5take}, {\tt mk5return}, and {\tt vlog}.
If you wish to upgrade the installation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}{\tt /calcif2}
\item Get updates from the repository: {\tt svn update}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}







% difx2fits -------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{difx2fits}

The initial NRAO adaptation of DiFX is designed to interface as seamlessly as possible into our existing infrastructure and habits.
This means generation of FITS-IDI output files for compliance with AIPS.
The program {\tt difx2fits} takes many input files (see Fig.~\ref{fig:block}) and produces a FITS file for every DiFX input file.
To install:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}
\item Check out the subversion repository: \\
{\tt svn co }\url{https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/applications/difx2fits/branches/difx-1.5}{\tt\ difx2fits}
\item Enter the new directory {\tt cd difx2fits}
\item View the {\tt README} file.  
Note the next 4 instructions only need to be done once in this directory, even after updating the repository.
\item {\tt aclocal}
\item {\tt autoconf}
\item {\tt autoheader}
\item {\tt automake -a}
\item Generate the Makefile: {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em prefixdir}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}

If successfully installed, the command {\tt which difx2fits} should return {\em prefixdir}{\tt /bin/difx2fits}.
If you wish to upgrade the installation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}{\tt /difx2fits}
\item Get updates from the repository: {\tt svn update}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\end{enumerate}








% mk5daemon -------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{mk5daemon {\small $\mathrm{(optional)}$}} 

\vspace{-20pt}\hspace{160pt}
\difxoneone

\vspace{7pt}

\noindent
The optional package {\tt mk5daemon} relies on package {\tt difxmessage} and is only really needed for installations requiring playback off Mark5 modules.
Root permission is required for proper installation and running of this program.
See \S\ref{sec:mk5daemon} for a description of the main program, {\tt mk5daemon}, that comes with this package.
Other useful scripts are included here.
To install:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}
\item Check out the subversion repository: \\
{\tt svn co }\url{https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/applications/mk5daemon/branches/difx-1.5}{\tt\ mk5daemon}
\item Enter the new directory {\tt cd mk5daemon}
\item View the {\tt README} file.  
Note the next 4 instructions only need to be done once in this directory, even after updating the repository.
\item {\tt aclocal}
\item {\tt autoconf}
\item {\tt autoheader}
\item {\tt automake -a}
\item Generate the Makefile: {\tt ./configure --prefix=}{\em prefixdir}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\item Ensure that this program starts at boot.
This requires the following to occur on each computer in the cluster.
Note that the instructions may vary depending on your operating system.
The program is likely to get started before NSF is started, so {\tt mk5daemon} should be installed locally on each compute in the cluster.
On each machine, run as root: {\tt cp }{\em prefixdir}{\tt /bin/mk5daemon} {\em localdir} {\tt ; echo }{\em localdir}{\tt /mk5daemon >> /etc/rc.local} .
Here {\em localdir} is a directory on the particular machine, such as {\tt /usr/bin}
This only needs to be run
\end{enumerate}

If successfully installed, the command {\tt which mk5daemon} should return {\em prefixdir}{\tt /bin/mk5daemon}.
If you wish to upgrade the installation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt cd} {\em sourcedir}{\tt /mk5daemon}
\item Get updates from the repository: {\tt svn update}
\item Build it: {\tt make}
\item Install it: {\tt make install}
\item Copy it to the local disk (as root): {\tt cp -f }{\em prefixdir}{\tt /bin/mk5daemon} {\em localdir}
\end{enumerate}








% vex2difx --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{vex2difx}

\vspace{-20pt}\hspace{95pt}
\difxonefive

\vspace{7pt}

\noindent
The {\tt vex2difx} program aims to convert any legal, complete vex format experiment description file into {\tt .input} and {\tt .calc} files for use with DiFX.

% difx_db ------------------------------------------------- NRAO ONLY ---------

\subsection{difx\_db {\small $\mathrm{(NRAO\ only)}$}}

\vspace{-20pt}\hspace{145pt}
\difxonefive

\vspace{7pt}

\noindent
Package {\tt difx\_db} contains several scripts that either make direct connection to the VLBA database or require site-specific access.
Thus, this package is not available from the standard DiFX repositories.
